# Build and install a bd whose beads module version matches the commit this
# repo's go.mod pins, so an installed gc and the standalone bd on PATH always
# share one schema catalog. gc migrates a city store forward on first write;
# a bd built from any other commit then fails every read with a schema-version
# mismatch, and the agent hook-check snippets used to surface that as an empty
# hook (city-wide silent standdown, 2026-08-25, ga-87h).
#
# The build runs in a scratch module, never in the gascity module: gascity's
# go.sum has no entries for bd's cmd-only dependencies, so building bd there
# mutates go.sum as a side effect. The scratch lives under /var/tmp, not /tmp
# (fleet convention: /tmp is a size-capped tmpfs shared with the harness).
